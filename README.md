# Blender projects

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the most popular open-source software for making 3D art.

The story of how I got into it is a bit convoluted. My sister's birthday was coming up, and since her area of study is environment, I was inspired by [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_It_X7v-1E) by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) to make a simulation of an ecosystem. The only programming language that I knew how to use at the time was Python, but it doesn't have much in the way of 3D graphics. The only option that I could see, [PyOpenGL](https://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/), would be too time consuming and complicated to learn.

However, I learned that Blender was built on top of OpenGL and had a python API. I downloaded Blender ([version 3.6](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.6/) was the latest at the time) but I was too unfamiliar with it, so I had to learn the basics (and it's not intuitive). I followed a series of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWWlyOf8n8) (this is the last one, they've been unlisted), which can be seen in the `Donut and tea` folder.

Eventually, I scrapped the ecosystem idea and decided that I would do a scene with a lone wolf in an environment, only using Blender (without Python). At first, I wanted it to be a forest, but I realized that making all the details would be way too complicated, so I settled for a snowy hill.
After a week of work, I finished with a wolfless scene. I didn't have time to learn how to model a living being, much less a realistic looking wolf, but I made the scene look as best as I could with a seamless looping animation.

I did not push the individual frames used for the animations.
